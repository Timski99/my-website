            <li>O'Connell Archery is a full-service archery shop, and we want to partner with you through all of your
                archery adventures. Serving the needs of archers of every level, we've seen it all and can help you with
                just about anything you might need.</li>
            <li>If you're just curious about archery and have questions, or maybe you're wondering how to get started
                with it, give us a call or stop by the shop and ask any questions you have. We're happy to answer your
                questions and have a conversation. We can help get you setup with everything you need to get on your way
                to becoming a world-class archer.</li>
            <li>Maybe you're a competitive 3D shooter and are traveling for a shoot or a tournament, and forgot
                something, or need some kind of equipment repair. Come on by and we can help. We have all of the gear
                that professional shooters need, and can help with nearly any maintenance needs that come up for you.
            </li>
            <li>Whether you bought your bow from us, or got it somewhere else and need help getting it tuned, we can
                help. Bring it in to the shop and we'll take a look at the setup you have, and make the adjustments
                necessary to have you slingin' tight groups in no time.</li>
            <li>Youth bow tuning costs $50.00. Standard setup/tune starts at $100.00. Full service cost may vary
                depending on your individual and equipment needs. We offer a package that we call "The Ultimate", which
                includes a full breakdown and custom built tune of your bow, everything from shimming to bare shaft
                tuning, laser tune, all to get you the most efficient and accurate setup matched to you and your
                shooting style. This package typically runs $150.00.</li>
