            <p>Don Cunningham:
                <q>Awesome pro shop, they got all you need, experience being the most important. Neil's a super cool guy
                    and runs a tight shift. Stop in and find out for yourself!</q>
            </p>

            <p>Gage Leigh:
                <q>I came in to buy some arrows and after talking to the guys about some issues I was experiencing they
                    ask to see my bow. Long story short, there was some major issues from the initial setup (done by a
                    different shop), but they came up with a plan of attack and I couldn't be more pleased with my
                    experience. Their customer service and professionalism was exceptional! At every opportunity they
                    treated myself and my 2-year-old like we were family. O'Connell's shop is definitely the right place
                    if you're needing anything archery. Keep up the great work guys!</q>

            <p>Thomas Nowrey:
                <q>Amazing staff and great selection. Came in and they were super helpful setting up my daughter's new
                    bow, even gave her a quick lesson to help her on her way. Only place I will go for archery from now
                    on.</q>
