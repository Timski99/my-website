        <p>When I took my first clients in the field back in 1987—I had no idea that today it would be my life’s work As
            it turns out I was preparing to be an outfitter my whole life. Educated in Natural Sciences, I began working
            as a park naturalist. Then for 14 seasons as a commercial long-line fur trapper from 1975-1988. After fur fell out of fashion and
        the market crashed, it was time to find a new career.</p>
        <p>A life long hunter, I found outfitting a natural transition.Truth is, the outfitting is a “feel good”
            business. Sharing experiences with intelligent clients every week, and making dreams come true, is very
            rewarding. The Staff and I have great passion for the task.</p>
        <p>We can’t get every client an elk on every hunt, but we have averaged 82% success on mature bull elk rifle
            hunts over the past 15 years.This is why we have been able to have a 65% repeat client business.We learned a
            long time ago that “word of mouth” advertising is the best advertising.Our objective every week, in every
            state and in every country is the same. We strive to meet or exceed your expectations. And that my fellow
            hunters, is the bottom line.</p>
