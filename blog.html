            <q>Awesome pro shop, they got all you need, experience being the most important.  Neil's a super cool guy and runs a tight shift. Stop in and find out for yourself!</q></p>

            <q>I came in to buy some arrows and after talking to the guys about some issues I was experiencing they ask to see my bow. Long story short, there was some major issues from the intial setup(done by a different shop), but they came up with a plan of attack and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience.
            Their customer service and professionalism was exceptional! At every opportunity they treated myself and my 2 year old like we were family. O'Connell's shop is definitely the right place if your needing anything archery. Keep up the great work guys!</q></p>
