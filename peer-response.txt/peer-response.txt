One of the things that I was going to do for the website on the bows page was to have a small image of the bows with links to that company's website with all the information on that bow. What was asked of me to do by the people who I am making the website for was to show a large image of the bows with only the name and a few specs on the bow. They did not want the links on there because then one could just buy the bow online and not come into their shop to make the purchase. 
Another recommendation was adding more information to your pro shop page such as a list of some of the services they offer in the pro shop page. I went ahead and added more information about what the company offers.
